# Migration from WooCommerce/WordPress to Native Next.js + Supabase E-commerce Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete migration strategy to remove dependencies on WooCommerce and WordPress from the Morandi e-commerce platform, transitioning to a fully native Next.js + Supabase solution with direct payment processing.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing WordPress/WooCommerce Dependencies

1. **Product Management**
   - Products fetched from WooCommerce REST API (`/wc/v3/products`)
   - Fallback to mock data when WooCommerce unavailable
   - WooCommerce sync API transfers products to Supabase
   - Product categories and attributes managed in WordPress

2. **Order Management**
   - Orders created in WooCommerce via REST API
   - Checkout process redirects to WordPress for payment
   - Order status tracking through WooCommerce
   - Email notifications handled by WordPress

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Razorpay integration through WordPress plugins
   - Payment confirmation handled by WordPress webhooks
   - Order status updates managed by WooCommerce

### Existing Infrastructure Ready for Migration

1. **Database Schema**: Complete Supabase/Prisma schema already exists
2. **UI Components**: Product display components already built
3. **State Management**: Cart and wishlist stores implemented
4. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js already configured

## Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Complete Independence**: Remove all WooCommerce/WordPress dependencies
2. **Enhanced Performance**: Direct database queries instead of REST API calls
3. **Better Control**: Full control over product data, pricing, and inventory
4. **Native Payment Processing**: Direct Razorpay integration without WordPress
5. **Improved Admin Experience**: Custom admin dashboard for better UX

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All products managed directly in Supabase database
- [ ] Complete order lifecycle managed natively
- [ ] Payment processing works without WordPress
- [ ] Admin can manage products, orders, and inventory
- [ ] Performance improved by 50% (no external API calls)
- [ ] Zero WordPress/WooCommerce API dependencies
